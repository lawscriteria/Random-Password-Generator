# Password Generator

#### Description: The Password Generator is a Python project that prompts the user to specify the strength of the password to be generated, and generates a random password accordingly.

### 

## How to Run: 

1) #### Install Python: Ensure that Python is installed on your system. 
    [Click here to install Python.](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2) Set Up: Once Python is installed, follow these steps:
    - #### Open your code editor or IDE
        If you do not have a code editor, you'll have to download one. Popular IDEs include [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows). Install and open your code editor of preference.
    - #### Open the Project File
        Open the file *random_password_generator.py* within the *random_password_generator* folder you downloaded. Note that it is a *.zip* file, so you will need to extract it using a *zip file manager*.
    - #### Run the Python File
        After opening the .py file in your code editor, run it.
        
    **Disclaimer: The program runs entirely within the text editor's terminal.**

## Password Strenghts

    u = {abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz}    #--> the complete set of letters in the alphabet, in lowercase.

    U = {ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ}    #--> the complete set of letters in the alphabet, in uppercase.

    L = u + U   #--> the complete set of letters in the alphabet.

    D = {0123456789}    #--> the complete set of digits.

    P = {!"#$%&'()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~}  #--> the complete set of punctuation marks.

Currect password strengths are:

#### (1) Very strong: composed exclusively of the english letters (lowercase & uppercase), the digits and the english punctuation marks.

    Let S | S ∩ {L, D, P} = S
####  where S is the password string,


#### (2) Strong: composed exclusively of the english letters (lowercase & uppercase), and the digits.

    Let S | S ∩ {L, D} = S

#### (3) Normal: composed exclusively of the english letters (lowercase & uppercase).

    Let S | S ∩ {L} = S

#### (4) Weak: composed exclusively of the lowercase english letters.

    Let S | S ∩ {u} = S
